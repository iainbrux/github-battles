# GitHub Battles :video_game: :trophy:

### What is GitHub Battles :question:

GitHub Battles is an app that allows you to input two GitHub usernames and an algorithm determined off numerous factors (stars, followers, etc...) will calculate a score and determine a winner in the GitHub battle! Battle between followers, colleagues or even fellow devs!

With GitHub Battles you'll also be able to see all the top repositories on GitHub either by language or by all time.

### About the project :sparkles:

This project will be my first ReactJS app that I will build whilst working through the React course on ui.dev.
